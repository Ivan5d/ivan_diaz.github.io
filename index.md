I'm a mechatronics engineer with a double degree from [_Tec de Monterrey_](https://tec.mx/en) (Mexico) and [_HTW Saar_](https://www.htwsaar.de/) (Germany) with a strong interest on robotics and machine learning algorithms.

## Main Projects 
{% include feature_row %}

## Research Interests
- Computer vision problems focused on robotics.
- Synthetic data generation for feeding ML algorithms.
- LLMs focused on robotics.

## News and Updates
- (Puiblication targeted for IROS 2025): Synthetic data generation for object detection and image segmentation tasks within underwater and hazing environments. _Under the advice of [Dr. Alberto Muñoz](https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?user=3o9-OssAAAAJ&hl=en)._
