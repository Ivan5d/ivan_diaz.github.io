## About myself

Hi! I'm Ivan, a double-degree mechatronics engineer from the Instituto Tecnológico y De Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (Tec de Monterrey) in Mexico and the Hoschschüle Für Technik und Wirtschaft des Saarlandes (HTW Saar) in Germany.

I've been on the robotics field since 2020 thanks to [Vanttec][vanttec_webpage], an undergraduated research team from Tec de Monterrey that focuses on autonomous vehicles. I started on computer vision algorithms and some robotics simulations for the Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV), which won a third place overall on the Robosub international competition.

In 2021, I started an exchange program with the HTW Saar in germany and eight months later I got a job at [Evocortex GmbH][evocortex_webpage], a german robotics startup. I wrote there my bachelor thesis and worked for two years on the Machine Learning (ML) department for the Evocarrier project, an Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) focused on automating warehouses.

In summer 2023, I came back to Mexico and become the project leader of the UUV. After a rough year, the UUV project came back to life and I finished my bachelor in june 2024. I gave structure to the UUV and, with help of more than 15 new members, I initialize multiple projects in parallel on the next departments: mechanics, localization, software, computer vision and control engineering.

Now I'm looking forward to initialize a masters for fall semester / spring 2026 semester in Asia, but in the meantime I've been working on a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for touristic information and tours at Tec de Monterrey and working at Omega, a local manufacturer.

Feel free to contact me at: ivan.d557d@hotmail.com I'm always willing to start new projects.
