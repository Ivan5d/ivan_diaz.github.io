## Bachelor Thesis

[Object Detection System Implementation for an Autonomous Mobile Robot using a Synthetic 2D-RGB Data Generation Approach. (1.3 in European Credit Transfer)](../files/Abschlussarbeit_300323.pdf)

- Problem (dataset shift): training with purely synthetic data (computer rendered images) significantly reduces the object detection rate in real world industrial scenarios (initial tests obtained a mean average precision lower than 50%).
- Contribution: following the domain randomization approach, the performance of neural networks during the detection task achieved an mAP slightly over 60% on real world scenarios.
